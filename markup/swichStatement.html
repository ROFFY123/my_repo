    <header>SWITCH STATEMENT</header>
    <p>"Switch statement" is a part of javascript's conditional statement that is used to perform different actions based on different condition. <br>We can use switch to select one of many blocks of code to be executed.</p>
    <p>Switch case is a conditional statement such as if else.</p>
    <p>The 'break keyword' is used to stop the execution or case testing inside the block</p>
    <p>The 'default keyword' specifies some code to run if there is no match case,there can only be one default in a switch which is also optional. <br>it's also nice adding it because it takes care of unexpected cases that are not included.</p>
    <p>We can call multiple functions easily for any case within each case statement,that really help writing clean and maintainable code.<br></p>
